# We Want Brave
## unofficial Brave browser installer for Linux (Debian-based)

**Background**

Brave browser is awesome, but setting it up on the various Debian-based Linux systems I regularly use, was an utterly exaspirating experience. It made me question my computer literacy, my decision to pusue a career in IT, my life choices in general, and even my sanity. But not for a single second did I doubt the superiority of Brave over alternative browsers. Hence, when I finally managed to slay the beast that was this excruciating installation process, I decided to share the wisdom I had acquired so as to spare others the anguish I suffered during this lonesome journey. From this solemn pledge was born *We Want Brave,* a script forged in the flames of frustration, despair and desire. Use it responsibly.

tl;dr
To make Brave browser more accessible to the (Debian-based) Linux community, this script automates the otherwise aggravating installation process. Enjoy.

**How to use**

Just clone or download the repository to your system. Then navigate to the directrory from the command line and run the script with sudo privileges by typing **"sudo bash we-want-brave.sh."**
